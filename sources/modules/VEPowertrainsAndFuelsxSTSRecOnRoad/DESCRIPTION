Description: Contains modules for inputting default powertrain and fuel
    characteristics and for allowing households to override some of the defaults
    with characteristics for their region. Calculates the carbon intensity of 
    fuels and assigns powertrains and powertrain characteristics to household 
    vehicles and car service vehicles. This scenario modifies the default values
    for the Oregon DOT Statewide Transportation Strategy recommended scenario 
    as of January 31, 2020 by lowering the ICEV MPG values by model year by 6% 
    to better match validation targets for fuel consumption.
